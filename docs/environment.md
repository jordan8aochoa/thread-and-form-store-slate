# Environment reference

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for development. Configure the same variables in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables. Keep staging/test and production values separate. Redeploy after changing browser-exposed values; restart locally after any environment change.

Only the three names beginning `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are public. Every other value stays server-side. The application does not need a Stripe publishable key because payment details are collected on Stripe-hosted Checkout.

`NODE_ENV` and `VERCEL` are runtime variables set by the framework/platform, not application secrets to add to `.env.local`. CLI login tokens and database passwords are setup credentials; use CLI prompts or your secret manager and do not commit them.

Keep key fields blank when running the read-only sample storefront. Invented provider keys do not enable checkout. A partially configured provider should produce a recoverable error, not a fake payment, shipping quote, or email success.

Use a stable staging domain for end-to-end tests so origin checks, callback URLs, and webhook destinations agree. Do not connect preview deployments to the production database or use live payment/shipping credentials in preview environments.
